// FIND THE ERRORS! Try and get this terrible code to compile and output the correct volume value
// You can look at both the default program that you get when you create new project
// and the learn resources for this week to help you solve the issues.

// there are 4 errors that need fixing (depending on how you count them)


// include the iostream library for the cout function
#include <iostream>


int main(int argc, const char* argv[]) {

    // define our volume variable
    float volume{ 0.5 };

    // print the message - the volume is: 0.5
    std::cout << "the volume is: " << volume;

    return 0;
